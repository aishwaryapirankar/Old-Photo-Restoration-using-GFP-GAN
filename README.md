# Old Photo Restoration using GFP-GAN

## Overview

This project leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically the GFP-GAN architecture, to restore old and damaged photographs. The GFP-GAN (Generative Photo Restoration GAN) is trained on a diverse dataset of historical images, allowing it to learn patterns and details specific to aged photos. The goal is to revive and enhance old memories by automatically restoring color, sharpness, and overall quality to vintage pictures.

## Features

- **Photo Restoration:** Automatically restores old and damaged photos.
- **Color Enhancement:** Improves color accuracy and vibrancy in faded images.
- **Detail Recovery:** Enhances fine details lost over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive for users to upload and restore photos.
